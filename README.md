# Implementation of standard data structures
This repository contains all of the lab work done in CCE 3rd Sem Data Structure Lab. The DS lab was a pretty intense lab but it was worth it.
We had alternative week evaluations. I learnt to implement the standard data structures without using any sort of libraries. It helped to internalise 
the concepts.

If you are a junior reading this, 
Keep following points in mind
- Try implementing all the programs and additional exercises yourself. Try to play around a bit
   and learn to deal with segmentation faults.
- Try not to copy. You can see somebody else's implementation for reference though, then try to write on your own. You will find yourself going back and forth 
  but that is okay. 
- These concepts will help a lot in Interview prep
- They will also act as foundation if you want to do competitive programming. CP and interview prep are different so
  please be aware of that difference. For CP, practice questions on Codeforces and Codechef
  - Take Part in contests.
  - Focus more on practicing problems on codeforces and upsolving. If your rating is x, then solve problems [ x, x+100 ] 
  - Learn required DS and algo on the go. Mostly, it's about raw thinking in the initial stage.
  - There are a lot of resources about guidance on Quora and Codeforces. You can check out them. Competitive programming is different from 
    normal data structures and algorithms that you implement in lab. You need to know that but you get good at CP by doing CP. You need to be 
    consistent and know the fact that it is going to be ridiculously hard. At the time of writing this, I am myself not good at CP. 
    But it's fun and one of the best ways to build problem solving, thinking, programming and debugging skills.

  - I would like to write a blog on CP (to save time for others) when I get good obviously xD.
You can find the following codes here

- Basic Searching and Sorting Methods 
- Stack implementation using array, linkedlists and applications of stack like prefix,infix,postfix evaluation
- Single, Double, and circular LinkedLists programs
- Binary Trees
- Binary Search Tree and expression tree implementation.

## Note
There is some non-DS lab material also but I have clearly marked it.
