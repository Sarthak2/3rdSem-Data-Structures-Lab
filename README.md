# Implementation of standard data structures
This repository contains all of the lab work done in CCE 3rd Sem Data Structure Lab. The DS lab was a pretty intense lab but it was worth it.
We had alternative week evaluations. I learnt to implement the standard data structures without using any sort of libraries. It helped to internalise 
the concepts.

If you are a junior reading this, 
Keep following points in mind
- Try implementing all the programs and additional exercises yourself. Try to play around a bit
   and learn to deal with segmentation faults.
- Try not to copy. You can see somebody else's implementation for reference though, then try to write on your own. You will find yourself going back and forth 
  but that is okay. 

You can find the following codes here

- Basic Searching and Sorting Methods 
- Stack implementation using array, linkedlists and applications of stack like prefix,infix,postfix evaluation
- Single, Double, and circular LinkedLists programs
- Binary Trees
- Binary Search Tree and expression tree implementation.

## Note
There is some non-DS lab material also but I have clearly marked it.
