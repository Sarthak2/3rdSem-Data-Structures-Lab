# Implementation of standard data structures

This repository contains all of the lab work done in CCE 3rd Sem Data Structure Lab. The DS lab was a pretty intense lab but it was worth it.
We had alternative week evaluations. I learnt to implement the standard data structures without using any sort of libraries. It helped to internalise 
the concepts. (You are allowed to use libraries outside the lab so don't worry)

Feel free to make changes and maybe suggest better codes.

If you are a junior reading this, 
Keep following points in mind
- Try implementing all the programs and additional exercises yourself. Try to play around a bit
   and learn to deal with segmentation faults. Use cin and input some variable in between to debug(Thanks to Veena Ma'am xD)
   
- This repository is for your (and my reference). **So, use it when really required. But, do try your best and follow your teacher.**

- Try not to copy. **You can see somebody else's implementation for reference though, then try to write on your own.** You will find yourself going back and forth 
  but that is okay. 
  
- These concepts will help a lot in Interview prep/machine coding rounds and in general also, **they will make you a better programmer. **

- Data structures and Algorithms(Not in this course still) are very important. **You can get only get better by implementing and practicing stuff.**
  Further, this is mostly the implementation part. There are tonnes of DS related and algorithmic problems which you may come across later depending
  on whether you do interview/coding prep or you go one level beyond and do CP(do like seriously, CP is much more vast and logical)

- Learn about the time complexities involved. 

- **Try doing some related problems on GFG practice, LeetCode or InterviewBit (if time available)**. It's not necessary but I feel I could have practiced some problems. Also, for understanding concepts in these sites or YouTube is there. Channels like mycodeschool, Algorithms with Attitude, Back to Back SWE, Abdul Bari etc. **Check out MOOCs on Coursera also if interested.**

## What you can find here
You can find the following codes here

- Basic Searching and Sorting Methods 
- Stack implementation using array, linkedlists and applications of stack like prefix,infix,postfix evaluation
- Single, Double, and circular LinkedLists programs
- Binary Trees
- Binary Search Tree and expression tree implementation.

## Some thoughts - CP related 
- They will also act as foundation if you want to do competitive programming. CP and interview prep are different so
  please be aware of that difference. For CP, practice questions on Codeforces and Codechef. HackerRank problem solving section is good for starting.
  (I don't want to make this a CP blog so I won't write much here about resources. You will find on them on your own.)
  - Take Part in contests.
  - Focus more on practicing problems on Codeforces and upsolving. If your rating is x, then solve problems [ x, x+ 200 ] 
  - Learn required DS and algo on the go. Mostly, it's about raw thinking in the initial stage.
  - Do not learn all the algo and ds stuff first. Things don't work like that. You learn on the go by practicing and studying what is required.
  - There are a lot of resources about guidance on Quora and Codeforces. You can check them out. Competitive programming is different from 
    normal data structures and algorithms that you implement in lab. You need to know these concepts but you **get good at CP by doing CP**. 
    
    You need to be consistent and know the fact that it is going to be ridiculously hard. At the time of writing this, I am myself not good at CP. 
    But it's fun and one of the best ways to build problem solving, thinking, programming and debugging skills. (There are many other benefits).

  - I would like to write a blog on CP (to save time for others) when I get good obviously xD. Currently, I am busy with other programming related work.

## Note
There is some non-DS lab material also but I have clearly marked it.
