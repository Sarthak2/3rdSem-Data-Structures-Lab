Note
- You should know how to create a binary tree recursively and both iteratively. In the end semester exam, we were 
  asked to implement BT iteratively and very few people could do that. (I was one of them xD)
- Focus on traversals and try to understand the logic. It is mostly simulating the stack's Last In First Out property. Keep that in mind and 
  try to write iterative code yourself.(You can look at it and try to decipher the logic also)
- You can memorize some recursive calls. Just realise its dfs. You don't need to work out the whole recursion again and again.
- Memorization is an important thing but make sure you understand the code and can implement it. Soon, you won't need to memorize it. 
  You will soon get the intuition for recursive algorithms.
