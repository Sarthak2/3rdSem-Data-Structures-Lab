# Binary search
- One of the most important algorithms. A lot of Interview and CP questions can be solved with binary search.
  - e.g You can find out square root using BS. 
  - You can binary search the answer. Try Aggressive Cows problem on SPOJ.
  - Binary search implementation can have many bugs.
  - Check out Errichto's binary search video(If you have time currently)
- Use mid = low + (high - low)/2  
  
# Insertion sort
- This algorithm has the special property that if your [array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nearly-sorted-algorithm/) is almost sorted, then it performs good.
- You should be able to write this without reference.
